## American Kennel Club (AKC)  
**Home page:**  https://www.akc.org/

**Description:**  
Founded in 1884, the not-for-profit AKC is the recognized and trusted expert in breed, health, and training information for all dogs. AKC actively advocates for responsible dog ownership and is dedicated to advancing dog sports.

**Data breeds notes:**  
The AKC standard for each breed originates with a “parent club,” the AKC-recognized national club devoted to a particular breed. Each breed’s ideal physical traits, movement, and temperament are set down in a written document called a “breed standard.” Once approved by the AKC, a standard becomes both the breeder’s “blueprint” and the instrument used by dog show judges to evaluate a breeder’s work. There are over 340 dog breeds known throughout the world. The American Kennel Club recognizes 199 breeds, which are sorted into 9 groups: Sporting Group, Hound Group, Working Group, Terrier Group, Toy Group, Non-Sporting Group, Herding Group, Miscellaneous Class, and Foundation Stock Service. The Foundation Stock Service® allows purebred rare breeds to continue to develop while providing them with the security of a reliable and reputable avenue to maintain their records. Foundation Stock Service® is a requirement for fanciers of a breed who want to achieve full AKC recognition. FSS® breeds may now compete in Open Shows, Companion Events and Performance Events that AKC determines to be applicable.  Breeds must have a breed standard in order to compete.The breeds currently eligible to participate in the Miscellaneous Class are still enrolled in the AKC Foundation Stock Service®. FSS® enrollment is maintained until the AKC Board of Directors accepts the breed for regular status. Authorities acknowledge that throughout the world there are several hundred distinct breeds of purebred dogs, not all of which are AKC recognized breeds. Those officially recognized for AKC registration appear in the Stud Book of the American Kennel Club. The AKC provides for a regular path of development for a new breed, which may result in that breed’s full recognition and appearance in the official Stud Book as an AKC recognized breed.https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/

##  Domestic Animal Diversity Information (DAD-IS)
**Home page:**  https://www.fao.org/dad-is

**Description:**  
DAD-IS is a list compiled and maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). This list contains information on more than 15,000 national breed populations representing more than 8,800 breeds across 38 species. It is assembled, contributed to, and updated by country-nominated National Coordinators from 182 countries.

**Data breeds notes:**  
DAD-IS represents 2 types of breeds: “local breeds” (breeds reported in a single country), and “transboundary breeds” (breeds reported in several different countries). The instance of “transboundary breeds” that are reported in specific countries are called in DAD-IS “national breed populations.” In addition to the breeds' most common name and country of existence, DAD-IS reports on the domestication status, the extinction status of breeds, and the description of origin of the breeds. https://www.fao.org/dad-is

**Data breeds notes:**  
The FCI recognises 356 breeds in 10 groups: Group 1 - Sheepdogs and Cattledogs (except Swiss Cattledogs), Group 2 - Pinscher and Schnauzer - Molossoid and Swiss Mountain and Cattledogs, Group 3 - Terriers, Group 4 - Dachshunds, Group 5 - Spitz and primitive types, Group 6 - Scent hounds and related breeds, Group 7 - Pointing Dogs, Group 8 - Retrievers - Flushing Dogs - Water Dogs, Group 9 - Companion and Toy Dogs, Group 10 - Sighthounds. Each breed is the 'property' of a specific country. The 'owner' countries of the breeds write the standard of these breeds (detailed description of the ideal type of the breed), in co-operation with the Standards and Scientific Commissions of the FCI. The translation, updating and publication of the standards are carried out by the FCI. FCI breeds recognised on a definitive basis are eligible for the CACIB (Certificat d’Aptitude au Championnat International de la FCI) and for the FCI titles (Winner of the World Dog Show, Winner of the Section Shows – Europe, Asia and the Pacific, Americas and the Caribbean). FCI breeds recognised on a provisional basis are not eligible for the CACIB until they are recognised on a definitive basis, but are eligible for the FCI titles (Winner of the World Dog Show, Winner of the Section Shows – Europe, Asia and the Pacific, Americas and the Caribbean). In addition, the pedigrees issued to the dogs of these breeds have to carry the FCI logo. https://www.fci.be/en/Nomenclature/

## United Kennel Club (UKC)
**Home page:**  https://www.ukcdogs.com/

**Description:**  
A Kalamazoo, Michigan-based company founded in 1898, United Kennel Club is the largest all-breed performance-dog registry in the world, registering dogs from all 50 states and 25 foreign countries. The UKC is an international registry and currently recognizes over 300 separate breeds.

**Data breeds notes:**  
Each breed was developed for a specific purpose or function. The UKC standards contained herein are intended for use by people already familiar with the breeds they describe, such as responsible breeders and UKC judges. They are not intended for use by other organizations for breed identification and should not be adopted for those or similar purposes, either in part or as a whole. Each breed has its own breed standard. Breeds are assigned to one of 8 Groups based on its past and present function, historical origins and region of development: Companion Dog, Guardian Dog, Gun Dog, Herding Dog, Northern Breed, Scenthound, Sight and Pariah, and Terrier. Breed recognition is a significant landmark for a breed, in that it will become officially recognized by the world's largest performance dog registry. Full recognition entitles a breed to all the benefits of UKC, including, but not limited to, registration and participation in conformation and performance events licensed by the United Kennel Club. Therefore, the United Kennel Club prepared the following Breed Recognition Policies, all of which must be completed in order for a breed to be considered for recognition. Submission of this does not guarantee acceptance. The United Kennel Club does not consider a variation of an existing breed, or a result of a combination of two existing breeds, to be a new and unique breed. This includes, but is not limited to, differences in color, coat type, size or any disqualifications that may exist in the UKC Breed Standard for an existing breed. UKC reserves the right to refuse, correct or revoke any registration at any time. https://www.ukcdogs.com/breeds

## Veterinary Nomenclature (VeNom)
**Home page:**  https://venomcoding.org/

**Description:**  
The canine breed codes currently consist of breeds that are recognised by kennel clubs across the world. Where possible all synonyms of the same breed have been linked in the codes to each other, and are independent of their colour coding unless it is specific to that breed. Similar breeds have been grouped together using standard categories (e.g. Retrievers or Spaniels). The list is very inclusive to ensure all types of dog breeds are covered, and first generation pedigree crosses (such as Labradoodle or Puggle) are also included to assist with data capture. Non-standard cross breed dogs are recorded as synonyms of ‘Crossbreed’. https://venomcoding.org/venom-codes/

**Data breeds notes:**  
Note that not all dogs listed are recognized breeds by an official breed registry that can certify the dog is a purebred.
