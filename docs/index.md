# The Vertebrate Breed Ontology (VBO)

The Vertebrate Breed Ontology (VBO) was created by the Monarch Initiative, in collaboration with the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Animals ([OMIA](https://omia.org/home/)), as a means of incorporating all breed names into a single computable resource. The first version of VBO was based on the Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS) breeds list created and maintained by the United Nationsâ€™ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and has been created using standard semantic engineering tools including the Ontology Development Kit (ODK).

VBO serves as a single, computable resource for vertebrate breed names. It is used in databases such as OMIA and veterinarian health records to make non-human information more computable and consistent, therefore enhancing data interoperability.

VBO is restricted to non-human vertebrate animal species. It covers breeds and breed populations for livestock, companion animals, and laboratory animals.
